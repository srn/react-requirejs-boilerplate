# react-requirejs-boilerplate

Really simple boilerplate for getting up and running with React.js and Require.js. Includes a build step.

### Running

Use any http server. Running `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` should do the trick for now.

### Building

`$ node app/client/bower_components/r.js/dist/r.js -o app/client/build.js`

Check the output in `app/client/compiled/`.
